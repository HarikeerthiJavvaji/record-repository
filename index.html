      From July 2004 through June 2008, I was the director of the Dartmouth
      Institute for Writing and Rhetoric.

      I occasionally taught a graduate Computer Science course on how to write
      papers and how to give talks. I publish a list of usage rules that I
      required my students to observe.

      <p><i>Introduction to Algorithms</i></p>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Yes, I am coauthor of Introduction to Algorithms, along with Charles
      Leiserson, Ron Rivest, and Cliff Stein. For MIT Press's 50th anniversary,
      I wrote a post on their blog about the secret to writing a best-selling
      textbook.

      Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about Introduction to
      Algorithms:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <i>Will there be a fourth edition? If so, when will it be available?</i>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <u
          >The fourth edition was released on 5 April 2022. The MIT Press site
          for the book has links to sites that sell it.</u
        >
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Where can I find a list of errata?</i></dt>
      <dd>
        For the fourth edition, we maintain an errata page that allows you to
        list errors by date, by page, or by severity.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        For the second and third editions, we maintained an errata page that
        allows you to list errors by date, by page, by severity, or by
        discoverer. There is even an incremental update feature, allowing you to
        list only the errors posted since the last date that you asked about. We
        stopped logging errors for the third edition in January 2019 so that we
        could focus on preparing the fourth edition.

    <h3><i>Algorithms Unlocked</i></h3>
    <p>
      Algorithms Unlocked is a gentler, less technical, entry into algorithms
      than Introduction to Algorithms. It contains some mathematics, but not
      nearly as deep as in Introduction to Algorithms. The Amazon site for the
      book is here, and the MIT Press site is here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u
        >I maintain an errata page for Algorithms Unlocked. If you find an error
        in the book and it's not already in the errata page, send email to
        algorithms-unlocked@mit.edu. (The email address in the preface of the
        book is incorrectâ€”the first known error in the book.)</u
